""" Cryptographic component of fedmsg.

In general, we assume that 'everything on the bus is public'.  Even though all
the zmq endpoints are firewalled off from the outside world with iptables, we
intend to someday have a forwarding service setup that will indiscriminantly
forward all messages to anyone who wants them.  So, the issue is not encrypting
messages so they can't be read.  It is up to sensitive services like FAS to
*not send* sensitive information in the first place (like passwords, for
instance).

Since at some point, some services will respond to and act on messages that
come across the bus, we need facilities for guaranteeing a message comes from
where it *ought* to come from.  (Tangentially, message consumers need a simple
way to declare where they expect their messages to come from and have
the filtering and validation handled for them).

There should also be a convenient way to turn crypto off both globally and
locally.  Justification: a developer may want to work out a bug without any
messages being signed or validated.  In production, certain senders may send
non-critical data from a corner of Fedora Infrastructure in which it's
difficult to sign messages.  A consumer of those messages should be allowed
to ignore validation for those and only those expected unsigned messages

This module encapsulates standalone functions for:

    - Message signing.
    - Signature validation.

To accomplish this, we'll use puppet's already in place PKI involving X509
certificates and RSA signatures.
