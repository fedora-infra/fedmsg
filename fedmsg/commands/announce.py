    Emit an announcement message to the FI bus.

        $ echo "Fedora Core 4 has been declared GOLD" | fedmsg-announce \
                --link https://fedoraproject.org/news

    Technically this command is a simpler version of fedmsg-logger that emits
    on a special topic.  It is expected that :ref:`conf-routing-policy` is
    specified such that only restricted parties can issue fedmsg announcements.

    This command expects its message to come from stdin.
