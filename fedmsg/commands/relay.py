    ``fedmsg-relay`` is a service which binds to two ports, listens for
    messages on one and emits them on the other.  ``fedmsg-logger``
    requires that an instance of ``fedmsg-relay`` be running *somewhere*
    and that it's inbound address be listed in the config as one of the entries
    in :term:`relay_inbound`.

    ``fedmsg-relay`` becomes a necessity for integration points that cannot
    bind consistently to and serve from a port.  See :doc:`topology` for the
    mile-high view.  More specifically, ``fedmsg-relay`` is a
    SUB.bind()->PUB.bind() relay.
