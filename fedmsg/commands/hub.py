    """ Run the fedmsg hub.

    ``fedmsg-hub`` is the all-purpose daemon.  This should be run on every host
    that has services which declare their own consumers.  ``fedmsg-hub`` will
    listen to every endpoint discovered by :mod:`fedmsg.config` and forward
    messages in-process to the locally-declared consumers.  It is a thin
    wrapper over a moksha-hub.

    Other commands like ``fedmsg-irc`` are just specialized, restricted
    versions of ``fedmsg-hub``.  ``fedmsg-hub`` is the most general/abstract.

    ``fedmsg-hub`` also houses the functions to run a websocket server.
