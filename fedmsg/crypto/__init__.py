""" ``fedmsg.crypto`` - Cryptographic component of fedmsg.

Introduction
------------

In general, we assume that 'everything on the bus is public'.  Even though all
the zmq endpoints are firewalled off from the outside world with iptables, we
do have a forwarding service setup that indiscriminantly
forwards all messages to anyone who wants them.
(See :mod:`fedmsg.commands.gateway.gateway` for that service.)
So, the issue is not encrypting messages so they can't be read.  It is up to
sensitive services like FAS to *not send* sensitive information in the first
place (like passwords, for instance).

However, since at some point, services will respond to and act on messages that
come across the bus, we need facilities for guaranteeing a message comes from
where it *ought* to come from.  (Tangentially, message consumers need a simple
way to declare where they expect their messages to come from and have
the filtering and validation handled for them).

There should also be a convenient way to turn crypto off both globally and
locally.  Justification: a developer may want to work out a bug without any
messages being signed or validated.  In production, certain senders may send
non-critical data from a corner of Fedora Infrastructure in which it's
difficult to sign messages.  A consumer of those messages should be allowed
to ignore validation for those and only those expected unsigned messages

Two backend methods are available to accomplish this:

    - :mod:`fedmsg.crypto.x509`
    - :mod:`fedmsg.crypto.gpg`

Which backend is used is configured by the :term:`crypto_backend` configuration
value.

Certificates
------------

To accomplish message signing, fedmsg must be able to read certificates and a
private key on disk in the case of the :mod:`fedmsg.crypto.x509` backend
or to read public and private GnuPG keys in the came of the
:mod:`fedmsg.crypto.gpg` backend.  For message validation, it only need be
able to read the x509 certificate or gpg public key.  Exactly *which*
certificates are used are determined by looking up the ``certname`` in the
:term:`certnames` config dict.

We use a large number of certs for the deployment of fedmsg.  We have one cert
per `service-host`.  For example, if we have 3 fedmsg-enabled services and each
service runs on 10 hosts, then we have 30 unique certificate/key pairs in all.

The intent is to create difficulty for attackers.  If a low-security service on
a particular box is compromised, we don't want the attacker automatically have
access to the same certificate used for signing high-security service messages.

Furthermore, attempts are made at the sysadmin-level to ensure that
fedmsg-enabled services run as users that have exclusive read access to their
own keys.  See the `Fedora Infrastructure SOP
<http://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/infra/docs/fedmsg-certs.txt>`_ for
more information (including how to generate new certs/bring up new services).

Routing Policy
--------------

Messages are also checked to see if the name of the certificate they bear and
the topic they're routed on match up in a :term:`routing_policy` dict.  Is the
build server allowed to send messages about wiki updates?  Not if the routing
policy has anything to say about it.

.. note::  By analogy, "signature validation is to authentication as
           routing policy checks are to authorization."

If the topic of a message appears in the :term:`routing_policy`, the name borne
on the certificate must also appear under the associated list of permitted
publishers or the message is marked invalid.

If the topic of a message does *not* appear in the :term:`routing_policy`, two
different courses of action are possible:

    - If :term:`routing_nitpicky` is set to ``False``, then the message is
      given the green light.  Our routing policy doesn't have anything
      specific to say about messages of this topic and so who are we to deny
      it passage, right?
    - If :term:`routing_nitpicky` is set to ``True``, then we deny the message
      and mark it as invalid.

Typically, you'll deploy fedmsg with nitpicky mode turned off.  You can build
your policy over time as you determine what services will be sending what
messages.  Once deployment of fedmsg reaches a certain level of stability, you
can turn nitpicky mode on for enhanced security, but by doing so you may break
certain message paths that you've forgotten to include in your routing policy.

Configuration
-------------

By convention, configuration values for :mod:`fedmsg.crypto` are kept in
``/etc/fedmsg.d/ssl.py``, although technically they can be kept in any
config ``dict`` in ``/etc/fedmsg.d`` (or in any of the config locations checked
by :mod:`fedmsg.config`).

The cryptography routines expect the following values to be defined:

  - :term:`crypto_backend`
  - :term:`sign_messages`
  - :term:`validate_signatures`
  - :term:`ssldir`
  - :term:`crl_location`
  - :term:`crl_cache`
  - :term:`crl_cache_expiry`
  - :term:`certnames`
  - :term:`routing_policy`
  - :term:`routing_nitpicky`

For general information on configuration, see :mod:`fedmsg.config`.

Module Contents
---------------

:mod:`fedmsg.crypto` encapsulates standalone functions for:

    - Message signing.
    - Signature validation.
    - Stripping crypto information for view.

See :mod:`fedmsg.crypto.x509` and :mod:`fedmsg.crypto.gpg` for
implementation details.
