        default, ``fedmsg`` will try to guess the name of the module that
        called it and use that to produce an intelligent topic.  Specifying
        ``modname`` explicitly overrides this behavior.

        The fully qualified topic of a message is constructed out of the
        following pieces:

         <:term:`topic_prefix`>.<:term:`environment`>.<``modname``>.<``topic``>

        **An example from Fedora Tagger -- SQLAlchemy encoding**

        Here's an example from
        `fedora-tagger <http://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-tagger>`_ that
        sends the information about a new tag over
        ``org.fedoraproject.{dev,stg,prod}.fedoratagger.tag.update``::

          >>> import fedmsg
          >>> fedmsg.publish(topic='tag.update', msg={
          ...     'user': user,
          ...     'tag': tag,
          ... })

        Note that the `tag` and `user` objects are SQLAlchemy objects defined
        by tagger.  They both have ``.__json__()`` methods which
        :func:`fedmsg.publish` uses to encode both objects as stringified
        JSON for you.  Under the hood, specifically, ``.publish`` uses
        :mod:`fedmsg.encoding` to do this.

        ``fedmsg`` has also guessed the module name (``modname``) of it's
        caller and inserted it into the topic for you.  The code from which
        we stole the above snippet lives in
        ``fedoratagger.controllers.root``.  ``fedmsg`` figured that out and
        stripped it down to just ``fedoratagger`` for the final topic of
        ``org.fedoraproject.{dev,stg,prod}.fedoratagger.tag.update``.

        ----

        **Shell Usage**

        You could also use the ``fedmsg-logger`` from a shell script like so::

            $ echo "Hello, world." | fedmsg-logger --topic testing
            $ echo '{"foo": "bar"}' | fedmsg-logger --json-input
