============

If you're submitting patches to fedmsg, please observe the following:

 - Check that your python code is `PEP8-compliant
   <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
 - Check that your code doesn't break the test suite.  Instructions for running
   the test suite can be found in :doc:`development`.
 - If you are adding new code, please write tests for them in ``fedmsg/tests``.
 - If your change warrants a modification to the docs in ``doc/`` or any
   docstrings in ``fedmsg/`` please make that modification.
